# react-portfolio-project
Create a portfolio using React. I worked on this project with my tutor, Rober Kurle Jr., on May 13th, 2024. First we used vite to construct the skeleton of the project. Then we created all the components. Then we used App.jsx and main.jsx to create routing to the component pages. Then I added content to the component pages themselves (info and picture on the about me page, projects for the portfolio page, creating a form for the contact page, adding my resume to the resume page). Then we worked on the navbar and making it properly change pages without refreshing the page. Then I worked on styling the site. Finally I added the criteria for alerts on the Form page for when fields were clicked out of without text being entered and email validation.
